** Averager
In this testbench, "avg" and "D" are shown as unsigned
integers. avg_precise abd avg_DP are in hex. avg_DP represents the
sixteenths place of the hex output, avg is the whole number portion
of the output, and avg_precise is total hex output which includes both
the whole number portion and the avg_DP fraction concatenated.
